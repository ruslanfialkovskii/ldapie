# LDAPie Project Roadmap

## Project Status (May 2025)

LDAPie is a modern LDAP client command-line interface tool inspired by HTTPie's user-friendly approach. It provides a rich, colorful terminal interface for LDAP operations using the ldap3 library for LDAP functionality and Rich for beautiful terminal output.

The project has implemented all core features including comprehensive LDAP operations, multiple output formats, and an interactive mode. This roadmap consolidates information from all planning documents to provide a comprehensive overview of the project's current state and future directions.
